# Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,floor division,modulus) on them.
# 1.Addition:
sum_of_number = 8
sum_of_number += 2
print(sum_of_number)

# 2.subtraction:
difference_of_number = 10
difference_of_number -= 2
print(difference_of_number)

# 3.Multiplication:
product_of_number = 3
product_of_number *= 4
print(product_of_number)

# 4.Division:
division_of_number = 4
division_of_number /= 2
print(division_of_number)

# 5.floor division:
floor_division_of_number = 24
floor_division_of_number //= 5
print(floor_division_of_number)

# 6.modulus:
counter_of_number = 26
counter_of_number %= 5
print(counter_of_number)
